2a. The device I see that dont have a mountpoint when I run lsblk is sr0.

3. After running du in /etc, the directory with the most memory is selinux/

5. The df command shows the files systems disk usage. If you run the -T flag it will show the type of file system.

6. The naming pattern that my VM is using for device is sda and dm. I belive that my VM is using SATA

7. Removable storage is mounted in /run/media

8. This question to me is still not clear, so far for what I read is that LVM makes it possible for one physical volume to
   have multiple file systems. It is still not clear to me if this is the main purpose of LVM or the only function it has.
